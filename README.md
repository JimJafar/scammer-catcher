# Elysia + Buchta App

## Getting started
This is a basic Elysia server with frontend support <br>
Run the following to get started.
```bash
bun create elysia-buchta ./elysia-app
cd ./elysia-app
```

## Starting the development server
To start development server run.
```bash
bun run index.ts
```

Open http://localhost:3000/ with your browser to see the result.

## Understanding file structure
[Buchta](https://github.com/Fire-The-Fox/buchta) is Bun-First integrable build step for frontend. <br>
Which means it can be used in a framework like Elysia, because it has offical integration.
```
index.ts - source code of your server with basic API
buchta.config.ts - basic configuration for Buchta to function
public/ - directory containing your frontend code
.buchta - directory that contains files with which Buchta works with
```

## Configuration
Very basic config for Buchta
```ts
import { BuchtaConfig } from "buchta";

export default {
    port: 3000, // port on which the application + the backend will be served
    rootDir: import.meta.dir, // root directory of your project, meaning you can start the app from where ever you are

    ssr: true, // if you want your web app to be server-side rendered
    plugins: [] // array that contains plugins for buchta to extend support for frameworks and file formats
} as BuchtaConfig;
```

## Built-in plugins
Buchta has plugins to support React, Svelte, Vue & CSS <br>
Some plugins have their own configuration, React for example

### How to use a built-in plugin?
If you want to use Vue. All you have to do is import it and put it in `plugins` array <br>
Just like this:
```ts
// Notice: Buchta supports on Vue 3
import { vue } from "buchta/plugins/vue";
// ...
    plugins: [/* ... */, vue()]
// ...
```
Same principle works for svelte, react and css <br>
